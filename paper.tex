\section{Introduction}

A botnet is a private network of computers infected with malicious software which allows them to be controlled by an entity known as the \textbf{Command and Control (C\&C)}.
The infected computers, referred to as \textbf{zombies}, are generally unaware that they are members of the botnet.
Botnets are most often used to send large quantities of spam emails and distribute denial of service attacks \cite{kapersky}.
Botnets provide the C\&C with the computing power of all zombies in the network while masking the identity of the true attacker.
In 2014 the Assistant Director of the FBI's Cyber Division presented an estimate stating that botnets have caused over
\$110 billion in damage globally \cite{fbi}.
\\ \\
As an analogy, imagine that you send an email to your 10 closest friends falsely claiming that a local ice cream store
is giving out free ice cream on a certain date.  Naturally these friends are excited and each of them forward this email
to their 10 closest friends.  This process continues, and soon enough thousands of people are under the impression
that they will be receiving free ice cream.
Your network of friends don't realize it, but they have just been turned into a botnet with the express purpose of shutting down the ice cream shop.
When the much anticipated date arrives, the store is flooded with customers demanding free sweets (it was advertised, after all).
Unable to handle the hoard of customers (zombies) the store is forced to shutdown for the day and focus their efforts in remedying the misunderstanding.
\\ \\
Who is to blame for the shop's loss in profits for the day?  The intent of the crowd was genuine,
and the continual forwarding of the email has made it virtually impossible to trace
it back to its source.  You were successfully able to harness the power of thousands
of people all while remaining anonymous.

\section{Motivation}
It's hard to justify the motivation behind infecting thousands of computers to
unwillingly act as ones personal army. Aside from deriving enjoyment from chaos,
it seems as though these motivations fall into two categories.

\subsection{Political}
In 2007 a botnet targeted the essential electronic infrastructure of the Republic
of Estonia \cite{estonia}. The attack brought down major banks, newspapers, and
even telecom companies. The inciting incident occurred when the Estonian government
removed a bronze statue from a city center built by the Soviets to commemorate those who died fighting
the Nazis in World War II \cite{estonia}. This act upset some political activists, who quickly
gained control of a botnet and unleashed it on the country.  Estonia remained under
fire for exactly two weeks, after which the barrage of traffic abruptly stopped.
This incident was the first of its kind, and revealed the unreasonable effectiveness
of botnets being used for politically motivated attacks.

\subsection{Economic}
To get an idea of how easy it is to purchase a botnet, a Google search for \quotes{\textit{botnets for sale}} garners 158,000 results.
The first of which is a website titled \quotes{\textbf{Hack Forums - Botnets, IRC Bots, and Zombies}},
where one can purchase pre-built botnets under a variety of different pricing schemes.
Recently a botnet containing 100,000 zombies claiming to be able to produce
1 terabit of traffic per second (enough bandwidth to make a relatively powerful server sweat)
was seen for sale at \$7,500 \cite{forbessale}. This underground market willing
to pay big money for powerful botnets provides a monetary incentive for the creators to make
their software as intrusive as possible.  The more zombies a botnet has control
of, the higher the price it will fetch.

\section{Mechanics}

\subsection{The Life Cycle of a Botnet}
\subsubsection{Recruitment}
In order to be effective, a botnet must have a large collection of zombies within its network of control.
Botnet creators commonly use a type of malware called a \textbf{worm} to recruit new members
\cite{lifecycle}.
Worms can be distinguished from other forms of malware by their ability to self replicate
in order to spread to other computers on the same network \cite{virustypes}.
This property is attractive to botnet creators as it promotes rapid spreading of the virus across
multiple hosts, and each new zombie adds an additional degree of separation from the source.
The techniques used to infect the initial set of zombies are consistent with
those used in general virus spreading.  These techniques may include social engineering,
embedding the virus in email attachments, and disguising the worm in phoney adware.
Once a new zombie is infected it \quotes{phones home} to the C\&C to register
itself as a member of the botnet, and then lays dormant awaiting a command
\cite{topology}.

\subsubsection{Command Propagation}
Once a sizeable network of zombies is formed the C\&C needs a mechanism for
relaying commands and updates. Interestingly, many of the different network topolgies
used to accomplish this bear similarities to those used in non-malicious settings.

\paragraph{Star \cite{topology}}
A single C\&C point of contact performs all communication with the members
of the botnet. This type of topology can be observed in Local Area Networks
where all computers are connected to the internet through a single router. As a
result it typically does not scale well with an increased number of zombies.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/startopo.png}
  \captionof{figure}{A botnet with a star communication topology}
  \label{fig:star_topo_fig}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{p{8cm} | p{8cm}}
  \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons} \\ \hline
  \textbullet{}Simple to implement                                    & \textbullet{}Single point of failure \\
  \textbullet{}Allows for rapid communication of commands and updates & \textbullet{}Large amount of network traffic traveling to and from single location\\
                                                                      & \textbullet{}Easier to locate C\&C
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Multiserver \cite{topology}}
Multiple interconnected C\&C servers coordinate to distribute messages to the zombies.
Thoughtful geographical placement of these C\&C servers can reduce latency across
large distances.  This technique can be seen at the global network core where each
Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides internet connection to a small subset of the population, with support for
inter-ISP communication accross long distances.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/multiservertopo.png}
  \captionof{figure}{A botnet with a multiserver communication topology}
  \label{fig:mulitserver_topo_fig}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{p{8cm} | p{8cm}}
  \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons} \\ \hline
  \textbullet{}Reduced load on each C\&C                    & \textbullet{}Difficult initial setup \\
  \textbullet{}Zombies can fail over incase of a C\&C crash & \textbullet{}Complicated to coordinate\\
  \textbullet{}Optimized for long distance communication    & \\
\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Peer to Peer (P2P) \cite{topology}}
No centralized C\&C, commands can be injected into the botnet at any zombie.
Each zombie that recieves a command will then fan it out to all known peers.
Generally these commands are signed with some sort of secret key to verify they
are coming from an authoritative source \cite{topology}. Botnets orgainized
this way are extremely difficult to shutdown as they generally implement redundant
connections \cite{topology}.  This type of topology is most famously used in BitTorrent,
a service where peers can directly share files with one another without the need for a central
repository.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{assets/p2ptopo.png}
  \captionof{figure}{A botnet with a P2P communication topology.  Note the lack of explicit C\&C}
  \label{fig:p2p_topo_fig}
\end{center}

\begin{tabular}{p{8cm} | p{8cm}}
  \textbf{Pros} & \textbf{Cons} \\ \hline
  \textbullet{}No central point of contact & \textbullet{}Command propagation could be slow \\
  \textbullet{}Difficult to shutdown       & \textbullet{}Members can be discovered by observing fanout messages\\
                                           & \textbullet{}Infected users may notice spikes in bandwidth usage\\
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Attack}
Once the botnet has been constructed and a communication infrastructure has been put into
place, it can be used to carry out attacks.  As stated earlier, there are two
main attack vectors utilized by botnets.

\paragraph{Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDos)}
DDoS attacks are among the least elegant of cyber attacks. Essentially, each
zombie in the botnet is ordered to repeatedly send requests to a given server.
The goal is to saturate the victim's server with requests to the point where it
can no longer service legitimate users.  These types of attacks are particularly
difficult to handle as the server cannot simply ignore requests from a single user,
it must distinguish legitimate users from members of the botnet.
This is a non-trivial task and is further discussed in section \ref{detection}.

\paragraph{Sending of Spam Emails}
Since sending thousands of emails from a single server/address is sure to raise a red flag
in spam detection softwares, botnets are used to distribute the load.  Each zombie
in the botnet is ordered to send a small subset of the desired emails. No single zombie
is generating enough emails to seem suspicious, but collectively a massive amount
of emails are being created. These emails typically contain paid-for advertisements
and malware riddled attachments.

\subsection{Techniques For Remaining Undetected}
Aside from infecting as many hosts as possible, the main goal for botnet owners
is to remain undetected.

\subsubsection{Encrypted Communication Protocols}
To provide better security and help prevent other users from hijacking botnets,
C\&C's can communicate with zombies (and vice versa) via encrypted protocols.
Increasingly botnets are moving to encrypted HTTP based protocols instead of
the once used plain text Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol \cite{botlab}.

\subsubsection{Polymorphic Packers}
Signature matching is a popular technique used in anti-virus software.  Once a new
virus is discovered, a unique signature is generated by sampling sections of the
binary content of the file. In order to stop anti-virus software from detecting
zombie software this way, botnet creators use \textbf{polymorphic packers} \cite{botlab}.
Polymorphic packers are able to construct two binary files which act identically, but will
produce completely different signatures. In order to leverage this property, each
time a zombie infects a new host it polymorphically repacks its binary file.  The result
is thousands of different signatures for the same zombie software, making it virtually
impossible for a signature based anti-virus to discern any kind of similarity.

\subsubsection{Fast Flux Domain Name System (DNS)}
Fast Flux is a technique which exploits the nature of DNS in order to hide illegal
operations inside of a botnet \cite{fastflux}. To fully understand how Fast Flux works,
some introductory knowledge on DNS is required.
\\ \\
\textbf{DNS} is a web protocol which, in a nutshell, provides name to address translation.
When you attempt to visit \quotes{facebook.com}, your browser first makes a query to
a DNS server to resolve the name \quotes{facebook.com} to an internet address which can
be used to make a connection.  In this way \quotes{facebook.com} is simply a convenient
alias for some longer (and harder to memorize) address. It is possible, and actually
beneficial, that a single name may have multiple addresses associated with it. This phenomenon
allows DNS servers to provide a basic type of load balancing between multiple servers.
Finally, each DNS record (name to address pairing) also contains a field called
the \textbf{time to live (TTL)}. This field indicates that the given record is only
valid for some period of time, after which it should be invalidated and re-updated.
\\ \\
In order to take advantage of the dynamic nature of DNS records, botnet owners
quickly cycle the address mapped to the name of an illegal website with that
of members in the botnet \cite{fastflux}. These mappings are assigned an unusually low TTL
(between 1 and 15 minutes), after which the address will be re-mapped to a
different member of the botnet.  These members act as proxies, forwarding requests to other proxies,
eventually leading to the actual server hosting the illegal content,
dubbed the \textbf{mothership} \cite{fastflux}. Consequently the set of suspected
hosts is in constant flux, leaving only one option to disrupt the malicious network:
shutting down the offending domain name at the registrar level \cite{fastflux}.


\section{Detecting Botnets Using Unsupervised Clustering}
\label{detection}

Unsupervised clustering is a common statistical analysis technique which partitions a set of unlabeled
observations into subsets known as \textbf{clusters}.  These clusters are formed in
such a way that observations within the
same cluster are more similar to each other, by some similarity metric, than
those in other clusters. A tool named BotMiner was developed in 2008 which examines
activity on large networks and performs clustering on the hosts \cite{clustering}.
The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that hosts belonging to a botnet will most
likely exhibit similar behaviour, and therefore fall into the same cluster.
To accomplish this, BotMiner uses two different similarity metrics: activity and
communication \cite{clustering}.  Activity clustering groups hosts based on the
types of activities they perform (e.g. port scanning, spamming, file downloading,
etc.) \cite{clustering}.  Activity clustering provides a high level model of which
hosts in the network are performing the same tasks, but does not contribute enough
information to be conclusive.  To aid in developing a low level understanding
of the network, communication clustering is also performed \cite{clustering}.
Communication clustering determines similarity using attributes such as average
number of bytes sent per connection, average number of connections per hour, etc.
These two types of clusters are then intersected, resulting in the potential
botnets \cite{clustering}.  What makes this approach significant is that
it assumes nothing about the specific structure or communication protocols of
the botnets in question, but relies only on their general nature.
